Robin.js
========
Every superhero needs a sidekick. Batman.js is no exception.

Realtime
--------
Okay, let's face it: realtime updates are awesome and the future of web apps. But they're a pain to use from scatch for anything more complex than a couple models. We'd like things to just "autoupdate" and add functionality as desired to react to live updates. That's where Robin.js comes in.

Credit where due!

Much thanks to @zhubert for his `fancy_batman_app` with Pusher updates. I started from his code and rewrote it to work with Faye and a slightly cleaner architecture.
